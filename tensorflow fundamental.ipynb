    "## Part 1: Theoretical Question:\n",
    "**1. Different Data Structures Used in TensorFlow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow primarily utilizes two main data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tensors**: Tensors are the fundamental data structure in TensorFlow. They are multi-dimensional arrays used to represent data of various types (e.g., scalars, vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays). Tensors can have dynamic shapes and are the building blocks for defining and manipulating neural network operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "  - Scalar: `tf.constant(5.0)`\n",
    "  - Vector: `tf.constant([1, 2, 3])`\n",
    "  - Matrix: `tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graphs**: TensorFlow uses computation graphs to represent a sequence of operations. A computation graph defines the flow of data between tensors and operations. Graphs can be constructed using TensorFlow's high-level APIs (e.g., Keras) or using lower-level TensorFlow operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Define a computation graph\n",
    "  a = tf.constant(2.0)\n",
    "  b = tf.constant(3.0)\n",
    "  c = a + b  # Addition operation\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. TensorFlow Constant vs. TensorFlow Variable**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TensorFlow Constant**:\n",
    "  - Constants are tensors whose values cannot be changed after they are initialized.\n",
    "  - They are typically used for fixed values in a computation graph.\n",
    "  - Constants are created using the `tf.constant` function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "  constant_value = tf.constant(5.0)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TensorFlow Variable**:\n",
    "  - Variables are tensors that can be modified during the execution of a computation graph.\n",
    "  - They are used for model parameters, such as weights and biases, that need to be updated during training.\n",
    "  - Variables are created using the `tf.Variable` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "  initial_value = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])\n",
    "  variable = tf.Variable(initial_value)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  It's important to note that when working with variables, you need to explicitly initialize them using `tf.global_variables_initializer()` and update their values using operations like `assign`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Matrix Operations in TensorFlow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matrix Addition**:\n",
    "  - Matrix addition in TensorFlow is straightforward. You can use the `tf.add` function or the `+` operator to add two tensors of the same shape.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "  \n",
    "  matrix1 = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "  matrix2 = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "  result = tf.add(matrix1, matrix2)  # Element-wise addition\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matrix Multiplication**:\n",
    "  - Matrix multiplication can be performed using `tf.matmul` or the `@` operator for tensors with compatible dimensions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "  \n",
    "  matrix1 = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "  matrix2 = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "  result = tf.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)  # Matrix multiplication\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Element-Wise Operations**:\n",
    "  - Element-wise operations involve performing an operation (e.g., addition, multiplication, etc.) between corresponding elements of two tensors of the same shape.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "  \n",
    "  tensor1 = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "  tensor2 = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "  result = tf.multiply(tensor1, tensor2)  # Element-wise multiplication\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are fundamental building blocks for constructing neural networks and other machine learning models in TensorFlow."
